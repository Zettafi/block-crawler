Core Components
===============

Core components are the basic building block for building your own crawler.
They include:

* :doc:`bus-components` to manage the process of crawling
* :doc:`rpc-components` to communicate with RPC APIs
* Stats Components for tracking the performance of individual components or the crawler
  as a whole
* Data Client Components for communicating with HTTP/ IPFS, and Arweave metadata
  providers
* Storage Client Components for storing metadata
