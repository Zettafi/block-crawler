Core Components

Core components are the basic building blocks for building your own crawler.
They include:

* :doc:`bus-components` to manage the process of crawling
* :doc:`rpc-components` to communicate with RPC APIs
* :doc:`stats-components` tracking the performance of individual components or the crawler
  as a whole
* :doc:`click-components` to integrate with click commands
